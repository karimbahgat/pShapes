# pShapes

Early stages of the pShapes project. Reverse geocoding all natural earth level 1 provinces 
backwards in time. Doing so by identifying mergers, splitters, info changes, and transfers
(in which case a dividing geoline will have to be identified). 

Statoids is the main source for changes, and historical maps are for geotransfers. 

Record changes in excel for maximum reusability with different province datasets, 
process.py will do the backwards change tracking to the shapefile.
