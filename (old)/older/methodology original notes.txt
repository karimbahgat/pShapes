Starting point should be natural earth admin1 provinces using country boundaries from cshapes. Ie cut each country only internally. 

How to:

For each country and corresponding provinces:
	Take intersection between each province and the country
	Group the results by province and union them with the unique parts of the country that are not in the province shapes (the difference)
	Voila!

More realistic though:

For each country and corresponding provinces:
	Take only the intersecting parts between each province and the country (where both agree on the country) -- this trims away any disagreeing slivers, thus resulting in some gaps between provinces and country outline where another country is enroaching over into the country. 
	Consider the remaining provinces belonging to our country, and get only the internal borders between them, not the country boundary, by doing difference(lines(provinces), lines(union(provinces))
	Consider these internal boundaries and find any dangling nodes (ie any internal boundary vertex that only intersects with the internal boundary lines once, alternatively any vertex that is unique/only occurs once) not intersecting the country outline, ie where there are gaps. 
	Take those dangling nodes and find the closest point on the country boundary (or alternatively continue the line direction infinitely and take the point where it intersects the country boundary or another internal boundary in case of a sharp last angle), adding that point as a first or final vertex to the node's linesegment depending on which direction goes to the country border, thus closing the gap. 
	Now that every internal province boundary segment is connected to another segment or to the country boundary, we can use the province boundaries to cookie cut the country boundary.

Go backwards in time, create records indicating types of changes. One or more changes can be considered part of the same event if they happened at the same time (same eventid and date), eg boundary between two provinces changed and at the same time one of them changed names or capital. 

Basic types of building block changes:
	Geo new province
	Geo delete province
	Geo reallocation from provA to provB
	Name change
	Prov capital change
	Prov capital name change

Types of events and necessary change records are:
	Name change of provinces
	>> GIS SOLUTION: None, simply note the older name that was changed from.

	One province takes over/consumes another province
	>> GIS SOLUTION: Split along some line! Requires historical reference map/data. And add info about the province that was consumed, and add additional changes in info about the province that expanded. 

	Pure merging of provinces into an entirely new province
	>> GIS SOLUTION: Split along some line! Requires historical reference map/data. And add info about the old provinces that ceased to exist. 

	Splitting of provinces
		Parts of old province becomes new province (breakaway)
		Old province removed, completely new entities emerge to take its place
	>> GIS SOLUTION: Merge! And add info about the old province. 

	Boundary between provinces changes
	>> GIS SOLUTION: Union the affected provinces and split along some line! Requires historical reference map/data. Add any additional info about province names or capitals prior to the boundary change that if any additional changes were made. 

	Old province lost entirely (eg to another country)
	>> GIS SOLUTION: Simply create a new feature with geometry and info about the lost province. 

	New province created out of nowhere, affecting no other provinces
	>> GIS SOLUTION: Simply note that the province did not exist prior to that point.

Manual work:
	Transfer - Old prov gave away territory or was merged with another, ie newer prov was the result of receiving all or parts of an older prov in the event, ie it grew
		Identify from and to provs
		Cut away the part of the receiving prov that was received (by drawing splitline)
		Mark which part was given (by drawing centerline)
	Breakaway - Old prov split into multiple newer provs, ie newer prov was the result an older prov splitting, ie it shrunk
		In either case, just identify from and to provs (no cutting

Auto script:
For each composite prov (ie it received territory from another):
	Cut into subparts based on geotransfer entries.
After processing all changes for the event:
	Group all subparts by old prov (incl the newer prov if survived and incl breakaway provs created from a split)
	If only one subpart and no surviving newer prov, means that that part was the entire province (and was thus consumed in the event).
		Just create the old prov as that part
	If only one subpart and surviving newer prov, means that it only gave away a part of itself.
		Union with the newer prov to show its old extent.
	If multiple subparts and no newer prov, means that the prov gave away parts to more than one province and was dissolved
		Union all subparts. 
	If multiple subparts and survived, means that the prov gave away parts to more than one province and survived 
		Union all subparts incl the newer prov. 

	PUT SIMPLER:

	Group all subparts by old prov (incl the newer prov if survived)
	If more than one subpart incl newer prov:
		Union all geoms
	Else:
		Just keep the part

Loop through all events backwards in time, and create the final dataset.

First, all current provinces are coded with start and enddates as if they existed since 1946. 

Per country, for each event in reverse time:
	Set startdate for all newer provinces involved to eventdate
	Crop each province to the cshapes country borders of that date and create a geochange for those that were affected (ie cshapes determines province changes resulting from country border changes)
	Out of all the changes:
	If geochange involved an old province disappearing:
		Create feature for the disappeared province, and set enddate to eventdate. Startdate will be taken care of by any subsequent events involving that province. 
	Elif geochange involved a new province appearing:
		Set the startdate of the newer province that resulted from that change to eventdate. 
	Elif geochange involved changing boundaries between provinces:
		Do the necessary GIS operation to create features for the older provinces (either merge newer provinces for a large older province that crumbled or clip by a linestring for many older provinces that merged together). Make eventdate into the startdate of the newer provinces, and into the enddate of the older provinces. 
	Finally:
		Do any additinal name or capital changes. 
	If just name or capital change:
		Just copy the newer feature and make the changes. 

Lastly, any province without a startdate is given the dataset startdate of 1-1-1946.
